# MonthsWebFront
Front-end part for a single page task management application written in pure JavaScript (without any frameworks, using only plain JS and browser API). The backend part of the application is located in a separate [repository](https://github.com/ImHereByChance/MonthsWeb).

The app is hosted at http://emilkadermetov.pythonanywhere.com/ if you want to see how it looks.
